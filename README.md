<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="images/SPC hardware.png">

### Floorheating usecase

Are you using floor heating and struggling with low temperature issues? The Smart Pump Control has the answer! By integrating this intelligent device into your heating system, you can optimize your energy consumption and maintain the perfect temperature in your home.

The Smart Pump Control is designed to work seamlessly with your heat pump and central heating system. It detects when either of these sources is producing heat and then intelligently activates your floor heating pump. This means you no longer have to keep the pump running continuously, wasting electricity when it's not needed. Instead, your heating system operates at its peak efficiency, saving you money on your energy bills.

### Take Control with Home Automation

With the Smart Pump Control, you're gaining more control. You can easily monitor and manage your Smart Pump Control through popular home automation systems like Home Assistant. Adjust settings from the convenience of your smartphone or computer. It's a smarter, more connected way to manage your pump.

### Key Benefits of Smart Pump Control:
<ul>
    <li>Energy Savings: Reduce electricity consumption by only running your pump when necessary.</li>
    <li>Home Automation Integration: Seamlessly integrate with Home Assistant or other automation systems for remote control.</li>
    <li>Easy Installation: Simple setup ensures you can start saving in no time.</li>
    <li>Temperature based activation but also on external state triggers.</li>
</ul>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to setup your Smart Pump Control

### Installation

1. Connect the temperature sensors to the device.
2. Plug the device in an electrical outlet
3. On your phone connect to the <b><i>SPC-S-AP</i></b> WiFi network for the socket version or to the <b><i>SPC-AP</i></b> WiFi network for the basic version and follow the steps to connect the Smart Pump Control to your WiFi network. It can take some time before the accessportal pops up so please be patient.
4. After the Smart Pump Control has been connected to the WiFi the Smart Pump Control can be accessed via [http://spc-s.local](http://spc-s.local) for the socket version and on [http://spc.local](http://spc.local) for the basic version.
5. On the device page it is possible to rename the device into a more meaningfull name (needed when using multiple Smart Pump Control's on the same network)
6. Update the configuration to your liking


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Autodetect IP of the external trigger system based on the provided url
- [ ] Different pump activation temperatures for summer and winter
- [ ] Default behaviour when the external trigger system is not available (activate pump / deactivate pump)
- [ ] Delta triggering, when difference between two sensors is above a threshold activate the pump (scenario: difference between flow and return)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/patrickvorgers/SPC/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
